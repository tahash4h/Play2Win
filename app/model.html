    <p>Based on the sophisticated XGboost model trained on 
    historical "Substance-Powers-Acts" data, the prediction 
    suggests a **[New Play Name]** play will have the highest 
    success rate of **[Predicted Metric Value]**. This forecast 
    takes into account the opponents' recent defensive power-ratings 
    and the temporal sequencing of past effective acts (run/pass, 
    zone penetration).</p>
    <p>
                    The model identified a significant correlation between high 
                    engagement of the midfield unit (Power-7) and successful 
                    transition acts (Act-3), especially in the final third of 
                    the game (Act-9). The new data point (predicted data) has 
                    been integrated into the plot on the right, shown as the 
                    dashed red line extending the trend.

                <p>
                    The predicted trend shows a clear [rising/falling/stable] 
                    success metric, indicating the recommended play is **highly 
                    viable** under current opponent conditions.
